### Static Site Generator
This is the part of my backend engineering curriculum on boot.dev
#### Steps on using it for yourself:
1. Have git installed in your terminal. check with "git --version".\
   if you dont have it, install using "sudo apt install git-all".\
   commands apply to linux of WSL on windows.
2. Then copy this git hub repository link:\
   https://github.com/SaadVSP96/Static_Site_Generator.git
3. Then clone the repository with the command "git clone" followed\
   the above mentioned link right after the command.
4. Make sure you make a folder seperate for this project and navigate\
   into it before you clone the repo into it. Once you have it cloned,\
    go to the folder and run the script "main.sh", it should work.
5. If it doesn't work and you're a friend, call me and I'll make sure it does,\
   and if you're someone in the industry, well, idk, I'm a newbie and\
   I try my best.


### Note:
This is one of the first large projects I did and I'll be honest\
Most of it isn't, my tries, failiures and successes are visible as\
my_version_# branches along with the main branch. By the end, I was\
plain following the boot.dev version, so I'd say I understand about\
60% of the project with good detail and the rest is, well, cursory\
understanding at best.
